Data Science Training Program Capstone Project
Proposal
1.	Team member: Grace Zhou
2.	Problem statement: Data scientists are interested in understanding anomalies in model performance metrics to proactively identify issues
3.	Goals: 
o	develop a time series forecasting model to predict anomalies in model features to proactively identify data issues
o	implement ARIMA models, Isolation Forest, and methodology in a paper titled “Finite Rank Deep Kernel Learning” on new data sets
4.	Success metrics: model performance metrics such as negative log likelihood
5.	Data: categorization model performance metrics' data from an internal dashboard
