Data Science Training Program Capstone Project
Proposal
1.	Team member: Grace Zhou
2.	Problem statement: Data workers at Intuit spend too much time understanding and cleaning data. Data profiling is very ad-hoc and time-consuming
3.	Goals: 
o	develop a time series forecasting model to predict anomalies in model features to proactively identify data issues
o	implement ARIMA models, Isolation Forest (link to paper), and methodology in a paper titled “Finite Rank Deep Kernel Learning” on new data sets
4.	Success metrics: model performance metrics such as negative log likelihood
5.	Data: Wavefront-Dashboard (subject to changes)
